        <p>By accessing or using blinq (the "Application"), a Python-based automated trading application for buying and selling stocks and options via the Alpaca Trading API, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Application.</p>

        <h2>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>The Application is an automated trading tool that interfaces with Alpaca Securities LLC ("Alpaca"), a FINRA and SIPC member, to execute stock and options trades. It is provided for informational and educational purposes only and is not investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell securities.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old and have a valid Alpaca brokerage account to use the Application. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>3. Account and API Access</h2>
        <p>To use the Application, you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Register with Alpaca and obtain API keys (API Key ID and Secret Key).</li>
            <li>Securely store and manage your API keys. You are solely responsible for any actions taken through your Alpaca account via the Application.</li>
            <li>Comply with Alpaca’s API Terms of Use (available at <a href="https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/">https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/</a>).</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Monitor all trades executed by the Application, as automated trading carries inherent risks, including system errors or market volatility.</li>
            <li>Not modify, reverse-engineer, or distribute the Application without prior written consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Risks and Disclaimers</h2>
